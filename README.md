# Wellness Reminder App

### Basically I have created simple web application for reminding user to do some activities by sending notification. I have used HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## Working
<p>
  1. First after opening web app, user need to allow permissions for receiving notifications. <br>
  2. Then user can start reminders for doing exercise or taking some rest by clicking buttons. <br>
  3. Then after specified time, nofication will be sent for reminding user to take some rest or do some exercise. <br>
</p>

### How to Run:
Just run `index.html` file on any browser.
